//Today's topic,

we can avoid creating all the files ourselves by using express generator that will give us
the folder structure itself and also it will write the basic code itself. - will write this
in Firstapp

express generator gives you a folder that means u don't have to create it yourself.

steps to use express generator:-

1) install it on laptop globally for atleast once in life. (npm i express-generator -g)

2) To create new app anywhere:
open cmd move to desktop
create new app
express appname --view=ejs
3) now use twp commands
cd appname
npm i 
open it on vscode. - using (code .)



//MongoDB

database - where our web application, any application's data is getting stored

relational- sql,mysql
non-relational : - mongoDB

    CODE SIDE                               MONGO DB SIDE
---------------------------  ----------------------------------
  
1) DB setup               ->                 1) DB formation
2) MODEL                  ->                 2) Collection 
3) Schema                 ->                 3) Documents 


every new app's data will be stored in a storage, but we'll store it in a container, 
that container will contain only that app's data..that container will be that app's database
 -----------|---------------
|           |               |                     
|   App's   |               |
|     DB    |               |
|___________|_______________|
|           |               |  ==> STORAGE
|           |               |
|           |               |
 -----------|---------------
 


that particular app's database will have further bifurcations too, that would be models(code),
the bifurcations that would be formed in database would be collections.

 -----------|---------------
|           |               |                     
|   Users   |     Product   |
|Collection | Collection    |
|___________|_______________|
|           |               |  ==> App's Database
|           |               |
|           |               |
 -----------|---------------


like users data, account data, product data, these are the models in code and collections in database

models(code) => collection(db)



Now, let's say we are inside that collection, let's say user's collections.
Now there will be a lot of users having data, like there age, name, address, phone, email
So, if we are talking about a particular user i.e documents.

 -----------|---------------
|           |               |                     
|   Users 1 |   User2       |
|    data   |    data       |
|___________|_______________|
|           |               |  ==> User's Collection(saare users ka data)
|           |               |
|           |               |
 -----------|---------------

 user'1 data => documents

schema(code) =>documents(db)


//install mongoDB server

1)Install mongodb from the site, 
2)the go to terminal, cd Downloads 
3)then find out the name of the mongodb file through the ls command
4)and do "sudo dpkg -i mongodb-org-server_7.0.6_amd64.deb"
5)then sudo systemctl status mongod--> it will show "Active: inactive (dead)"
6)now, to activate do "sudo systemctl start mongod"
7) now when you'll run "sudo systemctl status mongod", it will show Active: active (running)


Now, we have succefully installed mongodb server
To connect to this server and to create some database, we'll need utility names mongo sh for cli 

//Installing mongodb shell
1) Go to mongodb download site again and download mongodb shell - 
2) after downloading go to terminal and do "sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mongosh_2.1.5_amd64.deb"
3) mongosh => to check the status, if everything is working fine, this mongosh command is going to
connect your default mongo db server that is running on your local host
4) u can use command like
4.1) show dbs-> will show all the databases.
4.2) want to create databse -> use nameofdatabse.
5) To view this databse using "show dbs", u first need to insert some data, otherwise it won't be showing
6) To create collection, use db.createCollection("nameofcollection")
7)u can view collections, using "show collections"
8) To insert data, db.nameofcollection.insert({user:"Mukta"})

{Mongodb shell is working finee}


Now, installing mongodb compass,
1)Go to mongodb website, download mongodb compass.
2) Now go to terminal, and cd Downloads.
4) Then do ls and find the name of the file downloaded
3) then again do, sudo dpkg -i mongodb-compass_1.42.2_amd64.deb 
succesfully downloaded the gui .





//install mongoosejs (npm i mongoose)


//require 
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

//setup connection 
mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbname"); 

* here we are telling node to connect through mongoose to mongodb
* By this setup, a database named "dbname" is formed 

"mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017" -> local host, why local as it's running on our laptop



//make schema 

banne wala har document mai kya kya hoga...
const userschema = mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    name:String,
    age:Number
})
//create model 
This will form a collection, the first argument would be the name of the collection, 
and schema passed would give the structure of the documents that the collection contains


module.export = mongoose.model("nameOfCollection", Whichschema)


we are setting up this mongoDB in user.js



//CRUD operations.

create read delete done..


cookie and sessions: -> use to save data

client side- cookie (someone can hack or stuff data, that's why not safe)
server side - session (more safe)


//creating sessions :- install express-session
//we need to write 
var session = require("express-session);
app.use(session({
    resave:false,
    saveUnitialized :false,
    secret:"holamigokaisehotheekho"
}))


Now to make a session, go to any route file and right req.session.nameofsession ="hello"
nameofssesion named session craeted

now once you have created session, u can check it any of the route

create: req.session.name = value

delete

req.session.destroy


cookie

u need package cookie parser, but it comes along with express generator
