//What is INternet, how data gets transferred from one device to another, Isps..

2) router,ip, mac, server, client, isp, http, https, INternet

router..our phones are conneted to wifi and wifi is connected to internet...wifi takes the message

when we recieve a message, actually the wifi recieves it and them delivers it to the desired mac address

a computer that is programmed to serve files over the internet is known as server.

server doesn't require other parts of a computer other than cpu.request-response-client server architecture

server can be our normal computers where we have programmed it to serve and we can do other
computational process too but why to reduce the serving capacity.


http v/s https
http responsible why we can send and recieve data on internet.

we have to follow the rules set up by the creators of internet and all internet service 
providers would ensure that their users follow the rules of http.


in http, the data we transmitted are leaving out device in forms of packets to reach the
isps, but someone(hacker) can use another dongle and in the monitor mode, they can see 
the packets that is being transmitted from your computer..soo highly insecure

in htttps, data is transmitted just like how it is transmitted using http but it's encrypted..your
can't read it.


ports - > close ports and open ports ...ports are numbers, 4 or 5 digit, u can get connected
to the server via the open port.
