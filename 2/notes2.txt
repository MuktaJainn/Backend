What is backend developer?
=> backend developer is someone who programs sever and database.

why backend?
To make webistes more usable and purposeful, to make website dynamic(different users can see different data according to users.)

why not frontend alone?
without backened front-end websites are static.


nodejs, mongodb, mongoosejs, expressjs, 

what is install-> copying files in your computer, laptop, phone.


import/ export 

from where the data is present from there we do export and where you want to use that's where we import.
method of import - var d = require('./export')
method of export - module.exports = d


node js is c++ code that is taken from the chrome's v8 engine , this code is wrapped js code, and 
this always us to write js code as it will accept it, and it will create a server environment
according to c++ but only till it will run the code.

c++ language has the power to form the server, js doesn't have the power , so 
v8 engine's code can run js and can make a server but if we want to make a server we need to
write c++ code ...

so, we wrap the v8 engine's code in a wrapper...that wrapper is written in js,
the wrapper and v8 engine together is known as node.js..now this node.js allows us to 
make a server in using js package express.js


The machine code generated by the V8 engine is executed by your computer's processor (CPU). 
Once the V8 engine compiles JavaScript 
code into machine code, the CPU of your computer executes that machine code directly.

In summary, the execution flow is as follows:

JavaScript code is written by the developer.
The V8 engine (written in C++) compiles the JavaScript code into machine code.
The CPU of your computer executes the machine code, performing the desired operations 
specified by the JavaScript code.
So, the CPU is responsible for actually running the machine code generated by the V8 engine, 
which in turn executes your JavaScript code.

*npm usage*
npm doesn't have a full form today, in the past it was node package manager. why?
bwcause it has a lot of packages other than just of node, it has packages of react vue and even of java
on npm where we get the packages, like if you want to make a gaming console, u can just
copy the already written code of a remote why to make it from base and invest more time.

package provides that files of code.

npm is installed when we installed node.

how to install using npm -> npm i <name of package>


//What is express -> it's a framework for node.js

//use case -> routing

eg - https://www.facebook.com/profile

this   ..   -> /profile is route

main routes -> get, post 
put patch delete and more routes are there too, but the above two are main, others would
be useful when we'll study restful API

get route -> when there is no issue with your data being visible in the route

post route-> when youu don't want your data to be seen in the route like u wouldn't want
your email and password to be seen in the route


//Evertime u don't need to close the server, whenever you'll update the code.

u can just download nodemon package by npm i nodemon -g ...g basically that u won't have 
to install again and again- global install, otherwise it will install the node_modules
that is inside this express folder


was this getting error by that command..so used sudo npm install -g nodemon

//Middleware :- a function that is executed before the route. If you want to do something
before the route executed, u can use middleware..har route se pahle
