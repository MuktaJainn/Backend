Node.js has http but it would be so difficult to write a server using node.js's http
that's why we use express.js.


Node is capable of making a server, like cpu is capable of doing 2+2 =4, but like we 
need a calculator there for our calculation to occure, in node.js we needed to express.js or http
but yes raw http - difficult so we use express.js that under the hood gets converted to http only

express js is a package available but behind the scene its using http only, if
we would have to write http it would be so diffcult. WE can do routing, server side management
